mandala-docker
==============
A Dockerfile for setting up [mandala](https://github.com/remogatto/mandala) environment.

[Mandala] requires a lot of dependencies and the dependencies needs some manual setup steps, but it is terriblly hard work for most of people (including me). This project provides 'one-push setup' of mandala environment. You can start app development using mandala easily if you use this docker container.
